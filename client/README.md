# No Pressure Chore Tracker
So you never need to remember anything.
 * NO reminders
 * NO habit-building
 * NO gamification

## How it Works
* Write down everything you need to know about a chore so you will know how to do it next time.
* Let the app create today's agenda.
* Ignore things you don't want to do today.
* Know the last time you did a chore.

## Architecture
 * [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
 * Redux and Redux Toolkit
 * Material-ui
 * date-fns

## To Do
* Create todo table to keep a calendar record
* How to format datetime if a user moves to a different timezone
* Named parameters in postgresql query (use the postgresql node library)
* Use custom theme an clean up CSS
* Tidy up with better eslint
* Validate: CompleteDate must be after startDate
